- Fixed #1380 : "open links in popups ?" by providing the openLinkInPopup
  JavaScript method to open links in popup in an accessible way and not
  breaking conformance to the XHTML 1.0 Strict DTD.
Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Made the default profile define the new roles_managing_local_roles
  property.
- Added missing field expression for the Zip Uploader feature of the
  ImageGallery.
- Fixed #1518 by adding a title field in the File Widget, Image Widget and Photo
  Widget. This title field is used as the "title" and "alt" attributes on
  HTML images declarations. Updated the schemas and layouts definitions in the
  default profile.
- Updated Spanish translation thanks to Jesús Martín.
- logged_in only uses the last_login_time value to avoid tentative write access
  on a read only LDAP setup
- Better explanations in the login_form and account_lost_password_form pages for
  users who don't know their user name and/or password, or have lost them. Those
  pages are not just about lost password, they are also useful for users who
  don't even know their user names.
- Made document forms slightly more readable by putting more bottom margin on the
  fields
- Made account_request_reset_password display the acknoledgment message on
  itself instead on the portal front page which cannot display any psm message
  anymore.
