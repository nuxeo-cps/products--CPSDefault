  default policy that caches objects of type 'Filesystem Image' for one
  hour (HTTP headers)
- i18n of the password reminder feature
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed the cache of the portlet_contact_info custom portlet so that the
  portlet provide a correct accessibility link for each virtual hosts.
- Fixed security hole in forgotten password reset processing.
- the document portlet and the subfolders in the main content area were
  displayed along with the portal forms.
- #1073: made getImgTag more robust.

- Fixed #1205: Faulty logged_in redirect with a HTTPS secured site.
- #1161: Added a migration script to the "boxless" setup.

- Made the history of documents display the full name of the users instead of
  the usernames.

  previously
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Less restrictive permission check to allow
  a user to use the form in folder_contents
  was: 'Delete Folder', now is: 'Modify Portal Content'
  because the form button now handles correctly
  each perm.
- Removed obsolete widget types registration.
- tune #1133: getSortedContentTypes.py is too slow
- effective_date gets automatically updated at publish time (in
  section_content_wf) if no specific dates were set by the user
- CPSDefault.utils provides a fast filterContents function that replace the one
  in skins/cps_default/filterContents.py, the interface is changed a bit:
  * you must supply the `context` as the first parameter
  * `displayed` is renamed `filter_ptypes` and default is None instead of ['']
  * `sort_by` is renamed into `sort_on` and default is None
  * `direction` is renamed into `sort_order`
- CPSDefault.utils provides getFolderContents and getCatalogFolderContents.
- New indexes: container_path, position_in_container and nodes set.
- Adding a boolean property 'use_catalog_for_folder_contents' to a folder will
  makes the skins/cps_default/getFolderContents.py (and thus folder_contents
  and folder_view) uses the catalog to get the folder contents.
  This is faster especially on huge folder.
- added deprecation information for CPSBoxes modules.
- the "Edit this text" link on the welcome message goes to the portlet editor.
- added a temporary "folder contents" portlet in the main part of the screen
  until there is a more extended view for it (cf. #573)
- The "My preferences" action has now the standard CMF 'preferences' id and
  depends on membership tool like in CMF.
- Use the EventTest test setup code from CPSCore requiring Zope 2.9.
- CPS css_slot was renamed style_slot to comply with later CMF/Zope 3 standard.
