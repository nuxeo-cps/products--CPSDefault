Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New CPS logo.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Don't start the menu list if no section/workspace tab to generate.
- Removed the upper margin from l10n box introduced by the (appropriate!) p
  element.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- installer: auto install CPSNavigation product if present
- Structured header actions/accessibility anchors into a list.
- do not setup relative_path and relative_path_depth, this is done by
  cpsnavigation installer
- Overall accessibility improvements by :
    - using <input id="xxx"><label for="xxx"> markup in many forms
    - replacing <table> garbage by <dl><dt></dt><dd></dd></dl> markup
    - removing many useless <table> garbage
    - adding labels for language chooser and the search box
- In content_lib.pt, removed a now unused (it seems) filter form
  <tal:block tal:condition="filter"> in the batch indicator.
- Menu tabs have been completely refactored, starring semantics, code clear as
  a crystal, just two hacks, and half less CSS code. Enjoy!
- remove conditional IE 6 html to set a html 4 doctype, now IE handle xhtml 1.0
  and mozilla render in Standards compliance mode
- More versatile setFocus JavaScript function.
- Better default values for manage_addCPSSiteForm.dtml.
- Using PNG files instead of GIF files.
- Put the footer in the dedicated element (address) and updated the style sheets
  accordingly.
