Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Advertised content_lib_states.pt as a more generic information provider
  showing all the current revisions of the current document.
- CMF bugfix: use ExpirationDate metadata instead of ExpiresDate.
- Added a method fixupRoots() in cpsinstall.py to update the data model of the
  sections, workspaces and members folders. This is a temporary fix until we
  switch to CMFSetup.
- Made it possible to use HTML in portal status messages.
- Better messages for reset password for the "en" and "fr" locales.
- Made the returned logs of the installation of a new CPSDefault Site be in the
  HTML the format, so that it's more user-friendly and especially so that we
  have a refresh of the ZMI menu on the left, so that users can see their newly
  created CPS site.
- Member home folder did not have any title, it is now set to the member title
  at creation time, or its login if no title is available.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- cosmit on testI18n
- Moved boxes skins to CPSBoxes
- the list of roots of sections can be specified explicitly in
  getSectionsRoots.py (default is ['sections']).
- Installer uses the disableEventSubscriber() to disable portal_trees and
  portal_subcriptions during installation.
- Made folder_localrole_search and folder_localrole_form work with
  any id_field for the members directory.
- Membership tool now handles the personal calendar creation if portal_calendar
  exists, instead of letting CPSCore do it.
