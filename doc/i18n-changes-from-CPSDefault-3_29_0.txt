i18n Changes from CPSDefault 3.29.0
===================================

:Revision: $Id$

:Abstract: These is some explanation about changes to handle i18n
    from CPSDefault 3.29.0

.. sectnum::    :depth: 4
.. contents::   :depth: 4


UI locale selector
==================

This changes the ui locale like before, but also take effect on
object by:

- Use the selected locale, if available, to render a document.

- Use the selected locale, if available, for folder in the
  navigation trees.

- Changing the UI locale will reset all previous object locale
  selection saved in session.


Object locale selector
======================

For a folder under folder_view or for a document under view/edit,
there is a locale selector at the right of the title like: [en] fr
es.

Selecting an object locale doesn't affect UI locale selector, but
only the locale for this object.  This selection is sticky (using
session).  For example if you have an English document with a
path: path_to_object choosing another locale for this object is
done by accessing path_to_object/switchLanguage/fr, then further
access to path_to_object will return the fr selected locale until
you choose another locale.

Note that navigation trees don't take care of the object locale
selector and keep using the UI locale selection, which is correct.


Object locale selection
=======================

To know which locale will be chosen by CPS,
see i18n-changes-from-CPSCore-3_18_0.txt::

    ProxyTool:getBestRevision(proxy, lang=None)


Translation page
================

The translation page displays the list of available languages for
translation.  It removes from the list already translated locales.
Note that we have more object locales than UI locales.

The submission of this form creates a new revision of the
document, which is a copy of the current document revision.  The
proxy adds a reference to this new revision and locale. This
action also switches the locale of the proxy to the new one.


CPSDefault changes
==================

TreeBox:
    portal_tree via getFolderInfo store all locales title and description
    the tree box just used the correct locale according to Localizer
    selected locale

folder_view:
    display a list of available locale with switchLanguage link

getContentInfo:
    if entry is a catalog brain then we build rpath using catalog entry
    so rpath may be like rpath/to/proxy/switchLanguage/xx 
    
New CPSSchema/DocumentLanguageSelect Widget that display available
locale if any with switchLanguage link.  It is used on the common
layout.


Compatibility
============

By hiding the action_translate, you should have exactly the same
site and behavior as before without running any updater.

There should be no overload only benefits from getBestRevision
refactoring.


Todo
====

- Action to remove a translation.

- Check/optimize security re-indexing process.
