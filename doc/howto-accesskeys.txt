Accesskeys in CPS

Introduction
============

Accesskeys are used to improve CPS accessibility. This is a
required feature in order to be W3C WAI compliant.


Implementation
==============

The accesskeys in CPS are defined dynamically in a vocabulary.

If you want to change them just modify/edit the
portal_vocabularies/accesskeys vocabulary.

The "accesskeys" vocabulary is a kind of dictionary, or hash
table, that has the accesskeys as keys and paths as values. For
each key there is matching i18n label (msgid) that is used to
display the meaning of the accesskey on the dynamically generated
page http://www.mysite.net/accessibility.

The path for an accesskey in the vocabulary can start with a "/"
and in this case the generated URL in the web page for this key
will be the concatenation of the portal URL and this path.

If the path for an accesskey in the vocabulary does not start with
a "/", the generated URL in the web page will be the path
unchanged. This allows links such as
``mailto:webmaster@mysite.net``.


Example
=======

For example if you want to setup a dedicated contact page on the
URL ``http://www.mysite.net/sections/contact``:

1. Create a "Contact" Document in the "workspaces" folder.

2. Publish this document in the "sections" folder.

3. Modify the value for the "7" key to be "/sections/contact".

4. Visit the page ``http://www.mysite.net/accessibility`` to check
   that your key is described there and read the source of the web
   page to check that the link ``http://www.mysite.net/sections/contact``
   is correctly associated with the "7" accesskey.
