Accesskeys in CPS
=================
*$Id$*


Introduction
============

Accesskeys are used to improve CPS accessibility. This is a required feature to
be W3C WAI compliant.


Implementation
==============

The accesskeys in CPS are defined dynamically in a vocabulary.

If you want to change them just modify/edit the portal_vocabularies/accesskeys
vocabulary.

The "accesskeys" vocabulary is a kind of dictionary, or hash table, that has the
accesskeys as keys and paths as values. For each key there is matching
i18n label (msgid) that is used to display the meaning of the accesskey on the
dynamically generated page http://www.mysite.net/accessibility

The path for an accesskey in the vocabulary can start with a "/" and in this
case the generated URL in the web page for this key will be the concatenation of
the portal URL and this path.

If the path for an accesskey in the vocabulary does not start with a "/", the
generated URL in the web page will be the path unchanged. This allows to have
links such as "mailto:webmaster@mysite.net".


Example
=======

For example if you want to setup a dedicated contact page on the URL
http://www.mysite.net/sections/contact :

1. Create a "Contact" Document in the "workspaces" folder.

2. Publish this document in the "sections" folder.

3. Modify the value for the "7" key to be "/sections/contact".

4. Visit the page http://www.mysite.net/accessibility to check that your key is
   described here and read the source of the web page to check that the link
   http://www.mysite.net/sections/contact is rightly associated with the "7"
   accesskey.
