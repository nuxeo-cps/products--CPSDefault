*******************************************
** CPSDefault V3.25.0 [R1 build 2004/09/10-09:56 by ben]

Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
- Since the "content_icon" property has been changed for every document types to
  now use a PNG image, the cpsupdate external method MUST be run after you have
  installed this new version of this product.
  Be aware that if you have also customized some CPS ZPTs you should change
  occurrences of ".gif" by ".png".
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New CPS logo.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Don't start the menu list if no section/workspace tab to generate.
- Removed the upper margin from l10n box introduced by the (appropriate!) p
  element.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- installer: auto install CPSNavigation product if present
- Structured header actions/accessibility anchors into a list.
- do not setup relative_path and relative_path_depth indexes, 
  this is done by the cpsnavigation installer
- Overall accessibility improvements by :
    - using <input id="xxx"><label for="xxx"> markup in many forms
    - replacing <table> garbage by <dl><dt></dt><dd></dd></dl> markup
    - removing many useless <table> garbage
    - adding labels for language chooser and the search box
- In content_lib.pt, removed a now unused (it seems) filter form
  <tal:block tal:condition="filter"> in the batch indicator.
- Menu tabs have been completely refactored, starring semantics, code clear as
  a crystal, just two hacks, and half less CSS code. Enjoy!
- remove conditional IE 6 html to set a html 4 doctype, now IE handle xhtml 1.0
  and mozilla render in Standards compliance mode
- More versatile setFocus JavaScript function.
- Better default values for manage_addCPSSiteForm.dtml.
- Using PNG files instead of GIF files.

  previews already contain all this information.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The web site icon is renamed into site_icon.png so because it makes site
  customization more natural.
- Getting rid of some more GIF files (all non-animated GIFs can safely be
  converted to PNG - PNG can be used everywhere as long it doesn't use alpha
  transparency, because of stupid MSIE).
- Added translations for conformance statement box banners
- Added the "lang" and "xml:lang" attribute to the "html" element of the main
  template so that the locale is advertised to the user agents: this improves
  accessibility and improves ranking in search engines.
- Made manage_addCPSSiteForm.dtml use <label> elements for locale selection so
  that this form is more usable (the user can select both the checkbox and the
  locale name -- the "click-able" area is thus wider).
- Nice error message when you don't insert a valid login on the mail password
  form.
- folder_contents/folder_localroles_form/folder_factories: better css 
  integration
- nuxeo_css1: no more hardcoded Time police for q and blocquote tag
- Remove the old mail_notification reference within the cps installer which
  was inherited from the old CPSMailingLists
