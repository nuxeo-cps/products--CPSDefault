New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- installer: auto install CPSNavigation product if present
- Modified folder factories for it to be more accessible: now using
  <dl><dt></dt><dd></dd></dl> instead of all the <table> garbage.
- Removed useless <table> structures in content_lib.pt.
- In content_lib.pt, removed a now unused (it seems) filter form
  <tal:block tal:condition="filter"> in the batch indicator.
- Structured header actions/accessibility anchors into a list.
- Better wording for "legend_local_roles_assigned" in folder_local_role_form.
- do not setup relative_path and relative_path_depth, this is done by
  cpsnavigation installer
- Added more accessibility into folder_localrole_form.pt by using 
  <input id="xxx"><label for="xxx"> for entries.
