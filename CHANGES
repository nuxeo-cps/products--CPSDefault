Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- #1908: In section folders, document listings should display their effective
  date instead of their last modification date.
- #1890: Image without image breaks Image Gallery.
  Part of the fix includes setting 'is_required' to True by default for
  'preview' field in image layout.
  Another part of fix is in CPSSchemas.BasicWidgets to correctly handle
  'is_required' field when no image was supplied to 'Image Widget'.
- Better doc in the code.
- Improved folder_localrole_form to have all permissions in only one HTML table
  so that it is clearer.
- Better actionicon for CPS settings.
