Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added an MSIE behavior so that MSIE can handle CPS PNG images with alpha
  channel cf. http://www.scss.com.au/family/andrew/webdesign/pngbehavior/
- Using an image for the RSS feed link + improved explanation text.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Added back the translation for "welcome_body", it was lost because
  "welcome_body" had not been added into custom.pot.
- It is now possible to switch language from the register form without
  CPS displaying an error.
- Better wording for the login, register and join forms, button labels should be
  verbs like "Login", "Search", etc.
- Better HTML for the "reconfig_form" page.
- Use a "byline" class instead of hardcoded style in content_lib.pt
- Brought back consistency into the English translation: actions in the history
  naming scheme + systematic use of the word "revision" instead of "version".
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added more possibilities to getDateStr.py to display dates according to the
  ISO 8601 format and W3C recommendations.
- Added hidden/visible class for div tags. You can use them for JavaScript 
  display toggle.
