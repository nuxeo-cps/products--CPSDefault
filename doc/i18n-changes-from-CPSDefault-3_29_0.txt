These is some explanation about changes to handle i18n from
CPSDefault 3.29.0

$Id$


UI locale selector:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
this change the ui locale like before
but also take effect on object by:
- use the selected locale if available to render a document
- use the selected locale if available for folder in the navigation trees


Object locale selector:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
for a folder under folder_view or for a document under view/edit
there is a locale selector at the right of the title like: [en] fr es

selecting an object locale don't affect UI locale selector
but only the locale for this object, this selection is sticky (using
session)
for example if you have an english document with a path: path_to_object
choosing another locale for this object is done by accessing
path_to_object/switchLanguage/fr
then further access to path_to_object will return the fr selected locale
until you choose another locale

note that navigation trees don't take care of the object locale selector
and keep using the UI locale selection, which is correct.


Object locale selection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
to know which locale will be choosen by cps
see i18n-changes-from-CPSCore-3_18_0.txt
  ProxyTool:getBestRevision(proxy, lang=None)


translation page:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
the translation page display the list of available language for translation,
it removes from the list already translated locales,
note that we have more object locales than UI locales.
the submition of this form create a new revision of the document which is a
copy of the current document revision, the proxy add a reference to this new
revision and locale.
this action also switch the locale of the proxy to the new one.



CPSDefault changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
TreeBox:
    portal_tree via getFolderInfo store all locales title and description
    the tree box just used the correct locale according to Localizer
    selected locale

folder_view
    display a list of available locale with switchLanguage link

getContentInfo
    if entry is a catalog brain then we build rpath using catalog entry
    so rpath may be like rpath/to/proxy/switchLanguage/xx 
    
new CPSSchema/DocumentLanguageSelect Widget that display available
locale if any with switchLanguage link
it is used on the common layout


Compatibilty:
~~~~~~~~~~~~
by hiding the action_translate
you should have exactly the same site and behaviour as before
without running any updater

there should have no overload
only benefits from getBestRevision refactoring

Todo:
~~~~~
- action to remove a translation
- add a line in the status history when creating a translation
- check for garbage entry in catalog
- check/optimize security reindexing process
- UI language selector should reset all objects locale selection
