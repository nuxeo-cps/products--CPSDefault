Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- Fixed #1569: Catalog: the ZCTitle index is blank.
- Fixed #1667: Content portlet : title search does not work.
- Fixed #1790: Support the newer Zope 2.9.x versions (2.9.5 and upper).
- Fixed #1835: folder_contents / content_lib_display_contents is limited to
  100 objects.
- Fixed #1530: "Members doesn't have a 'last_login_time' or 'last_login'
  property anymore".
- Fixed #1847: "Add and use a "server_url" portlet cache parameter for the
  search, contact and conformance statement portlets".
- Updated the accessibility accesskeys information.
- Fixed #1848 by using a volatile variable in the EventRecorder class so that
  the functional tests relying on the CPSTestCase.CPSDefaultLayer when used with
  fast machines don't die with the the following error::

    return self._dump(meta, obj.__getstate__())
    TypeError: Can't pickle objects in acquisition wrappers.

- Updated the howto-virtual_hosts.txt to include doc about using a web cache.
- Updated the ZODB members directory profile so that is uses substring search
  for fullname too. This makes it possible to use CPSNavigation search in this
  context.
- In the RootsXMLAdapter added the possibility to be able to deal with multiple
  meta_type definitions defining the same meta_type and only considering the
  definition holding a class definition. This is for example to take advantage
  of the five:registerClass directive.
