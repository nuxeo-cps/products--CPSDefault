ZODB Requires:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ep: if you have a custom stylesheet_properties.props you must include:
 legendFontSize:string=80%
- Permissions on the repository have been tightened. To upgrade an
  existing site:
  - update CPSCore
  - update your workflows for sections and workspaces
  - in portal_workflows click on 'update security settings'
  - in portal_repository's security, check that for all permissions
    corresponding to special roles like 'permission:foo', the permission
    is not acquired and only given to Manager and foo.
  - reindex the tree caches in portal_trees.
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Id renaming form now displays a help message.
- Adding a property 'enable_portal_joining' to the portal that controls both the
  display of the 'join' action and execution of the register.py.

New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
