Ergonomics/usability
====================

CPS user interface should be designed to be usable.


Accessibility
=============

One should read http://diveintoaccessibility.org/ to have a precise idea about
what accessibility and interoperability are.

The site http://openweb.eu.org/ [fr] is also a must read, but only available in French.

Laws in Europe, France and the USA require that government web sites are
accessible::

  Les sites publics ont 3 ans pour etre accessibles aux handicapes

  Legislation - Apres un an de travaux parlementaires, la loi sur le
  handicap a ete adoptee le 3 fevrier. Dans son volet internet, elle
  impose aux sites de l'administration en ligne de devenir « accessibles
  aux personnes handicapees ».

XHTML
=====

General
-------

CPS follows the XHTML 1.0 Transitional DTD::

  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

But CPS is already almost XHTML Strict::

  <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">

So developers and web designers should code as if CPS follows already XHTML Strict.


Checkpoints
-----------

* Check your XHTML pages against the W3C validator: http://validator.w3.org/

  One can check one's HTML pages even if one's website is not reachable from the
  outside::

    $ curl --user yourlogin:yourpassword
           --location "http://localhost:8080/cps/workspaces/my_doc/cpsdocument_import_zip_form"
           > out.html

  And then upload your file to http://validator.w3.org/


* Don't use presentational elements and attributes in your code such as <b>,
  <i>, <center>, border="0". CSS properties take care of that.


* Avoid the <table> markup for layout purpose, and if you use <table> make
  sure to specify the "summary" attribute::

    <table class="listing" summary="A table listing the available events and their notifications in this context">


* Include <input> elements and <form> content into <p>

  As we are aiming for XHTML Strict, we should use a stricter markup::

    <form method="get">
      <p>
        Blah blah.
      </p>
      <p>
        <input class="standalone" value="Checkin of a revision" type="submit"/>
        <input class="context" onclick="history.back()" value="Cancel" type="button"/>
      </p>
    </form>


* Associate labels explicitly with their controls

  In other words it means: use <label> along with your <input type="text"/>,
  your <input type="checkbox"/> and your <input type="radio"/> elements.
  Using labels makes it possible to use the pointer on the label
  (clicking on the label) to active the input, so that it is easier to select a
  text input, a check box or a radio box, just like it is in heavy client
  applications such as Firefox.

  Example::

    <label for="firstName">First name:
      <input type="text" name="firstname" id="firstName"/>
    </label>

  cf. "Labeling form controls"
  http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG10-HTML-TECHS/#forms-labels


* Use the "id" attribute to provide relative location URL instead of
  the old <a name="xxx"/> markup.
  This is needed to do the transition to XHTML1.1.
  Example::

    <p>
      Check the <a href="#subject">subject headings</a>.
    </p>

    <h3 id="subject">Subject</h3>
    <p>
      Blah blah.
    </p>


* Structure your text into paragraphs using <p>.
  To create paragraphs do not use <br/><br/>.

  Example::

    <p>
      Blablah
    </p>
    <p>
      Blablah
    </p>
    <p>
      <input type="checkbox" name="item1" id="item1" value="xxx"/><label for="item1">Item1</label><br/>
      <input type="checkbox" name="item2" id="item2" value="yyy"/><label for="item2">Item2</label><br/>
      <input type="checkbox" name="item3" id="item3" value="zzz"/><label for="item3">Item3</label><br/>
    </p>


* Do not put spaces in strings:
  Write
  action="string:foo" (without space)
  NOT
  action="string: foo"
  that produces a link <a href=" foo"> which is a malformed URI.

  Example::

    action="string:foo"


* Form attribute method's value must be written with lower case letters::

    <form method="get">
      <p>
      </p>
    </form>

    <form method="post">
      <p>
      </p>
    </form>


* Avoid the "target" attribute, as it conveys layout information.
  But if you do use this attribute anyway, its value must be a single token:
  <a target="external_link">
  NOT
  <a target="external link">



CSS
===

General
-------

Sample CSS code::

  .tooltipArea {
    color: #000000;
    background: #ffffe1;
    padding: 0.8em;
    font-weight: normal;
    font-size: 80%;
    text-align: left;
    visibility: hidden;
    display: none;
    z-index: 1000;
  }

Here are the main aims in those CSS guidelines:

1. everybody follows the same convention, so the code is clean and easy to read

2. there is not too much lost space

3. diffs should be rare and easy to read

4. sizes are proportional so that the defined layout is "elastic" (scalable),
   diffs which is essential for accessibility

Basically those guidelines are what can be found in the CSS specs of the W3C,
though they put everything on the same line if there is only one property that
is used, but this is not practical if we want to diminish the occurrence of
diffs.


Checkpoints
-----------

* Check your CSS files against the W3C validator:
  http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

  One can check one's CSS files even if one's website is not reachable from the
  outside::

    $ curl --user yourlogin:yourpassword
      --location "http://meteore.in.nuxeo.com:9090/cps/nuxeo_css2.css"
      > out.css

  And then upload your file to http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/


* Indentation width of 2 characters inside parentheses

* No space before the ":" character and 1 space after

* 1 property definition per line

* The names of the Ids and classes should be written in mixedCase,
  for example "div.contentTabs", "div.bookPageHeader", "#idioma",
  "#byline", etc.

* The names to use for the selectors, that is the attributes "id" and "class" of
  the HTML elements, *should not* contain any "_" character.
  (the first CSS standards were not allowing the "_" character so old browsers
  like Netscape 4.x choke on them)

* Use the "em" unit instead of the "px" and "pt" units every time it's possible.
  The "em" unit is a proportional unit that scales according to the font size,
  so all the sizes specified in "em" will grown or shrink as the user asks her
  browser to increase or decrease the size of the text.
  This is essential for accessibility.

* Write the color codes in lowercase and in their full 6 digits hexa notation:
  #ffffff, #98a2b9, etc.

* It is possible and valid to specify more than one class for an HTML element::

    <table class="history listing" summary="Action history list">
      <thead>
     ...


* for CSS code generated through DTML, for example using
  <dtml-with stylesheet_properties>, the variable substitutions should be done
  by using <dtml-var color> and not &dtml-color; because HTML escaping is not to
  be done in CSS files.

  Sample CSS code using DTML variables::

    div.contentTabs a:hover {
      background: #ffffff;
      color: #000000;
      border-color: <dtml-var bordercolor>;
    }


JavaScript
==========

JavaScript should provide usability enhancements and can also be used to
decrease some server-side processing. But JavaScript should not be required on
the client-side to have a functional web site and usable functionalities.

A too heavy use of JavaScript clearly conflicts with accessibility.

It should be possible to visit, search, create/modify documents and navigate
through the web site using a browser without JavaScript support or with
JavaScript disabled.

Accessibility is of a prime concern for the front-office, since most of the
visitors and users of a web site use the front-office. Accessibility for the
back-office is something less important, but is still something developers
should care about.

Back-office management such as graphic decoration, color choosing, layout
setting, are already very visual concepts, and thus are not very accessible by
their very nature. Using JavaScript for such a back-office use is allowed. This
is what CPSSkins does.


Image formats
=============

The main format to use is PNG.

For all the products one will use images in the PNG format, because:

* PNG is a libre, free and open standard format defined by the W3C.

* PNG is, to this day, the most powerful format available for the web medium
  (lossless compression, alpha channel, gamma correction).

* PNG is not encumbered by any software patents.

* PNG is cool :-) It is much appreciated by techies and geeks alike, and is thus
  a factor of adoption of our products.

When it comes to landscape and photo-like style of pictures, PNG is not the best
suited image format, in terms of compression. In this case one could use the
JPEG format. But landscape and photo-type images are usually seldom found in CSS
and user interface skins. Landscape and photo-type images are more often present
as web site contents.


Tools
-----

Web design and graphic customization done on top of CPS are often delegated to
web designers and graphic designers who might not know well the PNG format. The
main reason for this is that most of them use Adobe Photoshop, and that
Photoshop as a poor PNG support. Photoshop doesn't compress PNG effectively and
handles gamma correction weirdly. The PNG format has many compression levels
(remember, lossless compression), from 0 to 9, but Photoshop only compresses up
to 6.

So web designers and graphic designers should be advised to either use the GIMP,
use a Photoshop plugin or use external utilities:

* **The GIMP**, the more widely available image manipulation program
  (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows)

  http://www.gimp.org/

* **SuperPNG**, Adobe Photoshop plugin, free of charge (Mac, Windows)

  http://www.fnordware.com/superpng/

* **PngOptimizer**, simple and efficient tool (Windows)

  http://www.psydk.org/PngOptimizer.php.


PNG vs GIF
----------

All browsers supports PNG, except Microsoft Internet Explorer (MSIE) that only
supports it partially. But contrary to the general belief concerning Microsoft
Internet Explorer flaws, it is very possible to use PNG in place of GIF.

Here is a why:

* GIF describes images with a 256 indexed colors scheme.

* PNG can describe images by using either an RGB 16 millions colors scheme +
  alpha channel, or a 256 indexed colors scheme.

* MSIE knows how to display GIF, RGB PNG without alpha channel or indexed PNG
  with optionally a transparency color (just as for the GIF).

=> So with the MSIE current state, it is possible to advantageously replace all
the GIFs (even with transparency) by PNGs. The only situation where GIFs cannot be
replaced systematically by PNGs, is when the GIFs are animated GIFs. This is not
a so common situation. There is a PNG equivalent yet, the MNG, but very few
browsers support it yet.


Technical details: The alpha channel
------------------------------------

It is still possible to use PNG RGB + alpha channel with MSIE if:

* One uses a specific *MSIE behavior* to enhance its native PNG support.
  For example CPS and CPSSkins ships with the following PNG behavior
  (but it is disabled by default):
  http://webfx.eae.net/dhtml/pngbehavior/pngbehavior.html

* One takes care to create with the GIMP the background layer of the image with
  the same color as the background color of the web page the image will appear
  in. Enable the "save the background color" option.



Translation recommendations
===========================

Checkpoints
-----------

* Use <tal:block> or <label> for translation strings, not span

  Use::

    <tal:block i18n:translate="msgid">A meaningful translation</tal:block>

  Or::

    <label i18n:translate="msgid">A meaningful translation</label>

  and NOT
  <span i18n:translate="msgid">blah</span>
  because it produces:
  <span>msgstr</span>
  with useless <span> elements that needlessly encumber the HTML output.


* Beware of empty <label>

  <label i18n:translate="msgid" />
  produces:
  <label />msgstr

  To produce <label>msgstr</label> one must write::

    <label i18n:translate="msgid">A meaningful translation</label>


* Provide a meaningful translation message example in the template

  Example::

    <tal:block i18n:translate="msgid">A meaningful translation</tal:block>

  and NOT
  <tal:block i18n:translate="msgid"/>
  because a meaningful translation will help translators later on.


Recommendations for .po translations
------------------------------------

Respect language specific punctuation

Ex: ":" should be preceded by an unbreakable space in French, but not in English.

Use proper capitalization.

Ex: Only the first word of each sentence is capitalized in French. In
English too, except for newspaper headlines (I believe). Anyway, choose
a consistent style and used is consistently.

Be consistent in the use of ":"

Group msgids by area.
