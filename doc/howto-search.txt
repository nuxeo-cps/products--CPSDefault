The (different) search capabilities of CPS
==========================================

There are 2 ways to search for documents in CPS:

  * skim through all the documents and test the documents one by one
  * query the indexes in the portal_catalog tool


Search indexes
===============

There are as many indexes in the portal_catalog tool that there are fields we
want to index in documents.

There are many different types of indexes. One should use them according to the
value of the document fields to index.

For fields that hold text values there are 3 possible index types:

  * TextIndex
  * ZCTextIndex
  * TextIndexNG



Search query syntax
===================

The "Searching and Categorizing Content" chapter of the Zope Book is very
helpful in explaining how to do searches through indexes:

Is it possible to do sub-string matching in queries?
----------------------------------------------------

It is possible to do both full-string and sub-string search, it all depends on
the field index type.

Only text-based string can be queried sub-string.

Field index type of *FieldIndex* are queried full-string. This type is used for
example for documents' titles.

Field index type of *ZCTextIndex* are queried sub-string. This type is used for
example for documents' descriptions.


Is it possible to use quotes in queries?

Is it possible to use jokers in queries (blabla*)?

Where can the jokers be used in words in queries (*blabla vs blabla*)?

Advanced search topics
----------------------

With some indexes it is possible to use AND/OR/NOT/etc/ associations. It is possible
to modify those associations, for example to use French associations:
ET/OU/PAS/NON/etc. To do that, special query parsing should be added to the tool.

It is also possible to drop left truncation feature.

Search in directories
=====================

Currently there are inconsistencies in the CPS user interface concerning
wild-cards and empty queries. In those cases, the search results in directories
are not the same than those in the local roles management forms and in the
document search forms.

This is a bit confusing but we will try to harmonize all the kinds of search as
soon as possible.
