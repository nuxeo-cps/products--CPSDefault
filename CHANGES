Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- #1908: In section folders, document listings should display their effective
  date instead of their last modification date.
- #1890: Image without image breaks Image Gallery.
  Part of the fix includes setting 'is_required' to True by default for
  'preview' field in image layout.
  Another part of fix is in CPSSchemas.BasicWidgets to correctly handle
  'is_required' field when no image was supplied to 'Image Widget'.
- Better doc in the code.
- #1913: The access rights (local roles) management form needs to be more
  usable.
- #1914: Make it possible to recursive publish for others than the Manager
- Better actionicon for CPS settings.
- Made the Prototype and Scriptaculous JavaScript librairies also available for
  the HTML pages that are not those of CPS documents, for example front pages.
  The aim is to be able to put JavaScript effects on front pages of web sites
  too, and not only for CPS documents.
