- #2050: generic handling of HTTP conditional requests
Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- #2124: sometimes, status message not displayed
- #2074: split navigation portlet render method
- #2110: getContextUrl breaks standard error rendering message
- #2111: Advanced search form should have a contextual title, presently it
  hinders both accessibility and SEO
- #2112: GenericSetup import of default portal language is not effective
- Updated accessibility online validator URLs
- Improved the description of the CollectorDocument description
- Set the max attached files count from 5 to 10, since it's more important to
  empower users than to restrict them, and if an administrator want to restrict
  this value he/she can do this later on, users workflows are not hindered in
  the meanwhile.
