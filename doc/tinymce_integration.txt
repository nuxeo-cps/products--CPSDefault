Introduction
============

.. _TinyMCE: http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/

TinyMCE_ is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

This file explain briefly how this integration was done, so that everyone is
able to do the integration of a new version of TinyMCE_ in CPS when it is
available and/or when the need arises.


Building receipt
================

Steps to build:

1. Install the needed files in the `skins` directory::

  $ cd Products/CPSDefault/skins
  $ unzip tinymce_3_2_1_1.zip
  $ mv tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce .
  $ rm -rf tinymce

2. Rename all ``.htm`` files into ``.htm.pt``

  For example::

    $ find -name '*.htm' -exec mv {} {}.pt \;

3. Then download and install some language packs (at least en, es, fr).
   If a language pack, for your currently selected language on the portal, is
   missing then the TinuMCE editor won't appear. So if you have any problem with
   the TinuMCE not appearing, the first thing to do is to try to access your CPS
   portal in English.
