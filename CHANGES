- WARNING: Some properties have been added to stylesheet_properties.props.
  If you overload stylesheet_properties.props you need to add the following
  properties:
  contextButtonBackgroundHover
  standaloneButtonBackgroundHover
  destructiveButtonBackgroundHover
  destructiveButtonBorderHover
  cf CPSDefault/skins/cps_styles/nuxeo/stylesheet_properties.props
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Added support for user password resetting.
- Added an interface to manage languages in a portal
- DocRenderBox can now render objects with give id (code need to be cleaned up,
  but the current implementation is currently not good enough anyway)
