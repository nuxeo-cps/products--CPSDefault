Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Nice error message when you don't insert a valid login on the mail password
  form.
- Made manage_addCPSSiteForm.dtml use <label> elements for locale selection so
  that this form is more usable (the user can select both the checkbox and the
  locale name -- the "click-able" area is thus wider).
- Added the "lang" and "xml:lang" attribute to the "html" element of the main
  template so that the locale is advertised to the user agents: this improves
  accessibility and improves ranking in search engines.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- fix: print rendering is ugly, font is too big
- fix #392: CSS with MSIE 6 broken
- Added translations for conformance statement box banners
- Correctly close tags in tree box site map.
- Removed title and description output in the embedded HTML preview since the
  previews already contain all this information.
- Getting rid of some more GIF files (all non-animated GIFs can safely be
  converted to PNG - PNG can be used everywhere as long it doesn't use alpha
  transparency, because of stupid MSIE).
- The web site icon is renamed into site_icon.png so because it makes site
  customization more natural.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- folder_contents/folder_localroles_form/folder_factories: better css 
  integration
- nuxeo_css1: no more hardcoded Time police for q and blocquote tag
- Remove the old mail_notification reference within the cps installer which
  was inherited from the old CPSMailingLists
