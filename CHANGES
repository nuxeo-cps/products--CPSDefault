Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~
- #1899: Workspace members cannot create blogs.
- config_form was protected by the "Manage Portlets" permission instead of the
  "Manage portal" permission.
- Made the check for the need to create a member area happen at every login into
  the portal, not only at the first login of a user. This is because the
  homeless property of a user can be modified after the first login of the user
  into the portal.
- #1900: It should be possible to set multiple RSS channels in a RSS portlet.
