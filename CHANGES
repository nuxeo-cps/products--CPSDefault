Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
- CPSCore > 0.27.0 for the new URL tool: cpsupdate has to be run again to set
  up the new tool correctly.
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Revisited the localroles management UI.
- Added the beginning of a document on
  "HOWTO use the search capabilities of CPS".
- Folder content UI now filters elements:
    + draft elements are visible just by managers and draft creator
    + locked and draft documents cannot be suppressed
  Notice that this is just UI level and that deletion will soon
  be implemented at workflow level see ticket #228
- Added focus on the title of new documents to create in the "folder_factories"
  form.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Improved coding style in cpsinstall.py.
- #699: Fixed workflow of workspaces so that they only manage 'View'.
- #388: better fr/en translations for virtual groups labels (role:Anonymous and
  role:Authenticated)
- #307: Local roles management empty user searching ; there was no search limit
  when searching for members/groups
- #492: Removing local roles to role:Anonymous unblocked roles acquisition
- removed the textarea width set to 100% in nuxeo_css1.css.dtml (this causes a
  layout bug in firefox when displaying tooltips)
- Fixed the way CMFCalendarToolPatch.py was getting the translation_service
  tool. This has the effect to fix CPSSkins unit tests.
- Taking advantage of the new centralized CPSI18n.tests.translations module.
- Fixed translation files through the CPSI18n/bin/fix_pos script.
- Fixed the URL displayed in exportRssContentBox (was exportRSSContentBox
  instead of exportRssContentBox)
- Fixed the computeContributors() method to work properly with anonymous
  contributors, previously it was crashing.
- Merged the files nuxeo_css1.css.dtml and nuxeo_css2.css.dtml into one
  default.css.dtml file. This is a step for the fix of bug #770.
- Renamed "nuxeo_print_css.css" into "default_print.css". This fixes the last
  point of #473 (Reorganizing /skins/cps_styles/).
- Added a declaration for the stylesheet of CPSBoxes. This is a step for the fix
  of bug #770.
- Modified some ZPT files so that they are valid XHTML 1.0 Strict. This is a
  work in progress to fix #773 "Using XHTML 1.0 Strict by default for CPS
  sites".
- #816: comments for !copy_submit(accept, reject, unpublish...) missing on
  publication history of a document.
- Gave to the SectionReviewer role the ChangeSubobjectsOrder permission in the
  sections. This is more logical. One who can accept/reject contents in sections
  should also be allowed to order them.
- Gave to the Owner of a document the permission to view his/her submitted
  document.
- fix #535: Redesign the advanced search form (completed)
- #838 use folder_contents as nav action only when explicitly requested in
  content_lib/info_detail
- Replaced portal_url with the new URLTool defined in CPSCore (extending the
  CMF one) to have methods dealing with virtual hosting: now able to get the base
  url (portal absolute url path), get an object absolute url from its relative
  url, and get its breadcrumbs without objects hidden with the virtual
  hosting. Fixes #436.
- fix #845: Added backward compatibility code to avoid recursion on the
  getBaseUrl script just before the portal_url update.
- Replaced incorrect code producing broken urls using virtual hosting.
- Changed the old orderedFoldered method names to the new OrderedSupport names,
  such as "move_object_up" to "moveObjectsUp", et al.
- fix #846: Language selector does not work for cps with boxes.
- fix #794 Missing translations in advanced search form
- Portal status message and check if there were items selected were missing
  for move up/down/top/bottom action in folder contents management page.
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Don't use strings for permission names in the installer.
- Added an example display method for formatting Gestalt's content items.
- Replaced Localizer by TranslationService.
- Moved computeContributors from CPSDocument to the utils module.
- Made the modify transition title more readable
- Roles relevant in context is now an optional argument to the script that
  returns assigned local roles.
- New javascript function getSelectedRadioLabel
- Do not use getBaseUrl and getContextUrl scripts to see if a role is set
  locally, but simply the object relative url.
