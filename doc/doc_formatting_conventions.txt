CPS Docutils and reStructuredText Conventions
=============================================

In order to maintain consistency across documentation for the
various CPS products, as much as possible, you should follow the
following conventions when creating and editing documentation in a CPS
product.


Formatting
----------

Titles:

- Document title: "=" over and under.  Should be in first three
  (3) lines of file

- Level 1: "=" under

- Level 2: "-" (dash) under

- Level 3: "." (dot/period) under

Bullet lists:

- Level 1: "-" (dash)

- Level 2: "+" (plus)

- Level 3: "*" (star)

Enumerated lists: 1., 2., ...

Code samples: "::" (double colon), followed by a blank line and
indent the code.

Interpreted text, domain- or application-dependent text, for example program
identifiers or explicit descriptive markup, "`" (simple back-ticks).
Examples: `portal_setup`, `i18n Updater`, `body`.

In-line literals and in-line code: "``" (double back-ticks) --
Example: ``print "Hello, %s" %s name``.

Emphasis: ``*...*`` for italic and ``**...**`` for bold.
Examples: ``*this is italic*`` and ``**this is bold**``.


Standard headers
----------------

Add the following near the top of the document (after the document
title).  It will generate a numbered table of contents near the top
of the document::

    :Revision: $Id$

    .. sectnum::    :depth: 4
    .. contents::   :depth: 4

An optional Author or Authors header can be used::

    :Author: - Stefane Fermigier

    :Authors: - Dave Kuhlman <dkuhlman@rexx.com> <http://www.rexx.com/~dkuhlman>
              - Marc-Aurèle Darche


Editing modes in Emacs and VIM
------------------------------

You should use the `rst-mode` under Emacs (which comes with the debian
python-docutils package). VIM ships by default with the `rst` filetype support.

Add the following at the bottom of the document.  These enable
Emacs and VIM users to automatically select the appropriate reST mode::

    .. Emacs
    .. Local Variables:
    .. mode: rst
    .. End:
    .. Vim
    .. vim: set filetype=rst:


Standard filename extension
---------------------------

What's the standard filename extension for a reStructuredText file?

It's ".txt". Some people would like to use ".rest" or ".rst" or ".restx", but
why bother? ReStructuredText source files are meant to be readable as plaintext,
and most operating systems already associate ".txt" with text files. Using a
specialized filename extension would require that users alter their OS settings,
which is something that many users will not be willing or able to do.

cf. http://docutils.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html#what-s-the-standard-filename-extension-for-a-restructuredtext-file


SVN properties
--------------

If this is a new document, set the
``svn:keywords`` and ``svn:eol-style`` properties on the file.
Example::

    $ svn propset svn:eol-style native xxxx.txt
    $ svn propset svn:keywords Id xxxx.txt

Optionally one could use more keywords::

    $ svn propset svn:keywords "Author Date Id Revision" xxxx.txt

But your SVN configuration, as described in dev_tools.txt_ should do all this
for you automatically.

.. _dev_tools.txt: dev_tools.html


Docutils: the set of programs to use
------------------------------------

In order to generate HTML docs out of the .txt reST files, one needs to install
the Docutils text processing system http://docutils.sourceforge.net/.

For example on a Debian system::

  $ apt-get install python-docutils

But we recommend that you use the latest snapshot,
http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docutils-snapshot.tgz. The
snapshots usually contain more features and fewer bugs than the "official"
releases and have better HTML rendering (for example the rendering of the
bibliographic fields such as author and authors).
