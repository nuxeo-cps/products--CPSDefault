- #1337: Refactoring of the roots import to allow better configuration.
- Fixed skin issue after upgrading CPS3.3.8 instance and importing all
  steps from CPSDefault profile: 'Upgrades' tab in portal_setup was
  producing  (AttributeError: 'search'), somehow 'search' skin was not
  found. In any case using tool methods is better way than skin scripts.
- To allow successful import of all steps from CPSDefault profile when
  upgrading CPS3.3.8 instance, code(upgrade step) was added to delete instance
  _properties and CMFDefault "dynamic" properties attributes from portal
  object.
- #1368: .py script in profile had wrong EOL -> errors on windows
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- members root folder is now a Members Workspace (CPS Proxy BTree Folder)
- added Flash Animation widget to the Web Document
- move byline in folder_contents according to #1290
- updated isInWorkspace script to take into account also the new Members
  Workspace portal type
- Favorites actions are disabled by default (#1248)
- removed "translate" action from document's workflow (#1347)
- adding Entry Local Role for allowing users to view the groups they belong to
- adding zpt for accessibility portlet
- #1375: Member role is checked by default when creating a new user
- Getting an icon with "path('here/'+ info['icon'])" does not work with Five
  products, so it was changes to the more generic method of using getImgTag.
- #1405: if there is only one content type allowed in folder_factories, skip 
  directly to the creation of that document
- rollback for [32481] as this is taken care now by folder_factories
