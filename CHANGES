Requires:
~~~~~~~~~
-
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- In ContentBox, the link to more results now points to the advanced search form
  prefilled with the box parameters.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Clean 'status_history' from portal_actions. See changes in getCPSDocuments and
  the closing commentary of bug #295 for what changed.
- In ContentBox, fix named arguments usage when constructing the query to more
  results.
- Removed "width: 100%" in DIVs. Some browsers don't digest them and they are
  useless.
- Smoothly avoid box buttons for users without home folder (closes #290).
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Replaced TABLEs and DIVs by DL/DT/DD in advanced search form; code much
  cleaner and base tests for prefilling chosen values when redisplaying this
  form (TODO).
- In ContentBox, use argument marshalling for allowing comparing dates.
