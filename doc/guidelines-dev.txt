About tests
===========

The public API of the products must be unit-tested and tests added in the
``tests`` directory of each product.

Public API unit tests should never be broken and should be maintained working
all the time.

Unit tests are useful during development time, but tests of private, inner,
lower-level parts should not go into ``tests`` and don't deserve all the pain
devoted to public API tests. So the solution for those tests in to do them as
doctests, and they can be wiped-out with no remorse once they become irrelevant
or more of a burden than helpful.
