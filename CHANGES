Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- Renamed the default portal box titles to make them more meaningful.
- Removed child selectors in the CSS because MSIE doesn't understand them.
- Disabled only the MSIE PNG behavior, but added back the MSIE conditional
  comment.
- #477 : CPS root folder shouldn't be an ordered folder
- Fixed the layout that was presenting all the roles glued together in
  skins/cps_default/folder_localrole_form.pt
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Renamed the "comment" input in transition forms into "comments", so that
  it is more consistent with the user interface.
- Made small fixes so that CPS HTML gets closer to XHTML Strict, that is
  only semantic and as less presentation information as possible, the CSS
  taking care of the layout.
- use CMFCore.permissions instead of CMFCore.CMFCorePermissions

- another attribute for ContentBox: no_recurse. This atribute is used for 
  the values of a checkbox; if the checkbox is checked (no_recurse=1) in the 
  box will be displayed only the documents from curent folder; if the 
  checkbox is unchecked(no_recurse=0) in the box will be displayed the documents 
  from curent folder and its subfolder.
