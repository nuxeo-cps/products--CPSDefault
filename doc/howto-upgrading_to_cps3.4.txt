CPS 3.4.0 supports upgrading from CPS 3.3.8.

CPS 3.4.2 supports upgrades from CPS 3.2.4 and 3.3.* (and of course from CPS 3.4.0).

**DO NOT UPGRADE A PRODUCTION SITE. Make backups first, or run the procedure on a copy.**

The best way to upgrade is to first do a new install of CPS 3.4 in a new
directory, and make sure it runs. Remember to make sure that you have all
products that you have on your old site installed in the new site, or the
upgrade will not work. Some products that exists in CPS 3.2 and 3.3 have been
deprecated in 3.4. These exist in the 3.4 legacy package:

  http://www.cps-project.org/static/src/CPS-legacy-3.4.2-1.tar.gz

If you have any custom products, you will need to install them as well, and make
any necessary changes to the for compatibility with CPS 3.4. See
http://svn.nuxeo.org/trac/pub/file/CPS3/trunk/doc/whats-new-cps-3.4/whats-new-cps-3.4.txt
for more information about things that have changed on the technical level.

After you have CPS 3.4 running, you stop the new server and delete the database
in the new installation, and copy in the database from the production site. (You
don't have to stop the production site, but of course, any changes made to the
production site after you copied that database will be lost from the upgrade).

In Unix::

  <newsite>/bin/zopectl stop                # Stopping the new installation
  rm <newsite>/var/*                        # Removing the new database
  cp <oldsite>/var/Data.fs <newsite>/var/   # Copying the production database
  <newsite>/bin/zopectl start               # Restarting the new server


The procedure from here on varies slightly depending on what version of CPS you
are upgrading from.


Upgrading from earlier versions of CPS 3.4.
===========================================

  Go to portal_setup at the root of your CPS (from the ZMI) and see,
  from the "Upgrades" tab, if some upgrades need to be run. Any
  upgrades that are to be run should be listed, and the ones that are
  runnable should be selected. Simply press the upgrade button. If no
  errors occurred, the upgrade went well.

  In unusual circumstances, you may note that an upgrade that was not
  selected before the upgrade is selected after the upgrade. In that
  case, press upgrade again. After all upgrades are done, there should
  be no upgrades listed.


Upgrading from CPS 3.3.8 or 3.2.4
=================================

1. Adding `portal_setup`

   Go to the CPS site and in the ZMI add a `CPS Setup Tool` from the `CPS Tools`
   menu item (do not add a `Generic Setup Tool`). Then go to the newly
   created `portal_setup` tool and run the upgrades. Before the upgrade
   the version number displayed will be "unknown". After the upgrade
   it should be "3.4.0".

2. Importing the profiles

   Go to the "Profiles" tab, make sure "CPS Default" is selected and
   press import. Importing this profile takes some time, and results
   in a working CPS site.

   As with all previous CPS upgrades, installing the default profile
   will reset the standard configuration objects, like portal types,
   workflows, schemas, layouts, etc, but custom objects are kept
   untouched. If you press "Reinstall" instead of "Install" the
   installation will also remove any custom objects.

3. Taking care of the member folder

   CPS 3.4 has it's member folder in <portal>/members, where CPS 3.2
   and 3.3 had it in <portal>/workspaces/members. You need to change
   the configuration back to the old path. Open the portal_membership
   tool, and change the path from 'members' to 'workspaces/members'.
   Note that in the CPS 3.4.0 release there is a bug here, where this
   path will be changed back every time you import a profile.

4. Other products and legacy products

   Go to the Profiles tab of the portal_setup tool. Select and install
   the profile for any of the products you used. If you had
   notifications set up in your old site, you will want to install the
   CPS Subscriptions profile, if you used the forums, you will want to
   install the CPS Forum profile and so on.

   The products in the CPSLegacy package is no longer supported and has
   no profiles. If you want to install them you have to refer to their
   respective documentation. For the CPSCalendar and CPSWebMail there
   are now the new replacement products CPSSharedCalendar and
   CPSMailAccess, which you probably would want to use instead. See
   their respective documentation on how to install and migrate from
   old versions.

5. Multiple upgrades

   In some cases installing profiles may enable upgrades that were not
   previously enabled. Go to the "Upgrades" tab and run any upgrades
   that now are enabled.

6. Last problems, the customizations

   If you still encounter problems after all those steps, the problems might
   come from customized versions of the ZPT (.py) or Python scripts (.py)
   present in your custom product(s). For example your product(s) might
   have customized `CPSSchemas/skins/cps_schemas/widget_attachedfile_render.pt`
   or any such file. The solution is to remove those customizations until you
   find the one(s) being the cause. Often those customizations can be removed
   since CPS has evolved and improved and you might prefer the current
   implementation in CPS. If it's not the case those customizations have to be
   upgraded to the current state of CPS.

7. Backing up the configuration with a snapshot

   Lastly, and this is a good idea to do after any configuration
   change, you should go to portal_setup and create a new snapshot.
   This way you can back out of any configuration changes. For example,
   if you make a snapshot before you install a product, you can
   uninstall the product by reinstalling the snapshot.
