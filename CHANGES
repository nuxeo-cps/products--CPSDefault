ZODB Requires:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ep: if you have a custom stylesheet_properties.props you must include:
 legendFontSize:string=80%
New features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Id renaming form now displays a help message.
- Adding a property 'enable_portal_joining' to the portal that controls both the
  display of the 'join' action and execution of the register.py. Thus it's more
  secure than just the 'visible' property of the 'join' action.
Bug fixes:
~~~~~~~~~~
- check/convert ID when "renaming" an object through folder contents
- changed button_rename translation as it was misleading
- #151: anonymous user can access box_manage_form
- dw: fixing TreeBox if root is a rurl deeper than 1 level?
New internal features:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- ep: adding legendFontSize in stylesheet_properties.props
- Content publish form for when your workflow need it.
- enable onclick javascript on actionbox link
